# weather-app
This is a small weather app that uses OpenWeatherMap API to allow users check weather based on US Zip Code. The app uses Local Storage to persist user provided zip code. Also, this app uses a service worker, allowing it to function offline once the content has been loaded at least once. 
In order to use the app, you just need to register for free API key from https://openweathermap.org and paste that API key in config.js file.
